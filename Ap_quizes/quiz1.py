print ("Assignment", Weight = Name)

# 5. You have been given a $100.00 dollar gift card from a family member. Another

# Your task is to create variables for each gift amount and a final variable that
# represents the total amount of money on your gift card. 

baseGIFTCardAmount = 100.00
familyAddedAmount = 50.00
friendAddedAmount = 35.00

totalGIFTCardAmount = baseGIFTCardAmount + familyAddedAmount + friendAddedAmount
Print(totalGIFTCardAmount)

# 6. Create a variable that uses the input function and then print that variable. Your variable 
# should ask a user to enter their name.

"IF they DO have an allergy - special"
"IF they DONT have an allergy - regular"
DoYouHaveAnAllergy = True
HasAllergy = False
# 9. In your own words, describe what a program is?
